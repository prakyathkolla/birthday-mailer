## Usage:
In the current scenario we sometimes miss wishing close people on the most auspicious day. So I created this for scheduling their birthday wishes using this application and incase if you miss it this application does it for you.

Create an account using Email and give the password and then click signup and you will receive an email with which you can login and from next time you can enter email and password and click signin.

And There You Go ! ðŸŽ‰

---

Integrated it with `SendGrid` for sending the email to Recipient's Email by configuring the email id.

Integrated it with `Supabase` for storing the scheduled birthday wishes.

Handled all the `timezone` issues in the backend. So you can just enter the time at which recipient should receive in their timezone and it will be done.

Configured the cron job running every minute to trigger email when the date and time is matched with current time in their respective timezone.

Used `IANA Timezone` for this.
